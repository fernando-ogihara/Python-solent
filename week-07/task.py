# The program should consist of the following two functions:

# The first function should be named observed and should have no parameters.
# def observed()
# The function should create a set named observations.
# The function should populate the set with the following items:
#     "Car", "Sky Scraper", "Sky Scraper", "Bike", "House", "House"
# Finally, the function should return the set observations.

# The second function should be named run_task1 and should have no parameters.
# The function should call the first function and display the set returned by the call.


# An example run of such a program is shown below:

# {'Car', 'Sky Scraper', 'Bike', 'House'}
